         A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. A text file with only FEN data records should have the file extension ".fen".[4]

         A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:[5]

         1. Piece placement (from White's perspective). Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "h". Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K"). White pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.

         2. Active color. "w" means White moves next, "b" means Black moves next.

         3. Castling availability. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside). A move that temporarily prevents castling does not negate this notation.

         4. En passant target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[6]

         5. Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. The reason for this field is that the value is used in the fifty-move rule.[7]

         6. Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
